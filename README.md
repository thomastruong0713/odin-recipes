# odin-recipes

A beginner HTML project for the purpose of putting all I have learned into practice.
In this project I am going to build a basic recipe website where I will have my index
page that will have links that lead to multiple recipes. By completing this project I will
have shown a very basic understanding of HTML and how to apply those basics.
