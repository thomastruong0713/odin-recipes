    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, 
            rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish and refrigerate  
            for at least 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and 
            the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in 
            the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
